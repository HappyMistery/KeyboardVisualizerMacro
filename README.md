# KeyboardVisualizerMacro
This Macro is used to start or stop the Keyboard Audio Visualizer from the website https://www.razer.com/chroma-workshop#--apps

This Macro works as a substitute for toggling your Chroma Audio Visualizer manualy when you want to use it. 

Steps to use:
- Download the Keyboard Visualizator from the website https://www.razer.com/chroma-workshop#--apps
- Change the name of the .exe file inside of your download:

- Download the batch file from this repository and save it wherever you want.
- Inside the batch file, change the EXE_PATH and EXE_NAME to match your path and name:

- Go to your keyboard's tab:

Hopefully this works for you :)
